gwt jsinterop feature demo projects

My first gwt 2.8.0 jsinterop projects are working. 

Note - the project is building properly against 2.8.0 snapshots and not beta1 release due to a bug in beta 1. 

Its a very simple working example that invokes a method from javascript into java. 

I intend to enhance and test all features of jsinterop here. Contributions are welcome.
